My first SQL project about a Superstore Analysis

SQL query that orders the items by price.
SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;

SQL query that will show a statistic about the item prices, like a sum, average, minimum, maximum, or count
SELECT SUM(price)
FROM superstore;

SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies".
SELECT MAX(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE price='Kitchen Supplies';

Own question about the data and try to answer it using SQL. For example: How many air purifiers are in stock?
SELECT COUNT(stock_quantity),item_name
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name='Air Purifier';
